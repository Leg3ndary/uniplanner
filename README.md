# UniPlanner

A year ago ish I made a fun hackathon submission that ended up winning first place at my school board.

Since then I've improved in a lot of areas and I've come back to this project, looking at it from afar it wasn't terrible but there was so much I could have easily done better.

Seeing as there isn't really a good way to plan out your university courses and see how they fit together I decided to make a web app that does just that.
